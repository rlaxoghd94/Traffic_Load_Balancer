# Traffic Load Balancer

### Team Members

### Project Purpose
Build a docker-based web service that can endure 100,000,000 traffic at once.

### Summary
Using `Nginx` as a reverse proxy with multiple `Node.js` applications, we can achieve a well-oriented load balanced web application. In addition to this, we'll be using `Kafka` clients per `Node.js` applications to communicate and execute actions on `Spring` applications while rendering `.html` files on `Node.js` applications.

### Handling Criteria
1. Git
2. Docker
3. Nginx
4. Node.js (Express)
5. Kafka
6. Spring
 - **Hold on to `Kafka` and `Spring` for later implementation**

### Dockerfile Approach
1. Import base-os image and add yourself as a `maintainer`; an author to be more exact
```
FROM ubuntu:18.04

# File Author / Maintainer
MAINTAINER Nicholas Taehong Kim & JongWon Song
```

2. Update `aptitude` and install necessary libraries such as: `Nginx`, `Node`, `npm`
```
# Install Nginx
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
	nginx \
	curl

# Download Node.js
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -

# Install Node.js and npm
RUN sudo apt-get install python build-essential nodejs
```

3. Copy necessary config files or node application codes:
```
# Copy all files from current directory to the base image(ubuntu:18.04 at the moment)
COPY . /my-files

# Since you've moved your files, set '/my-files/' as a default working directory
# This allows you from now on to use '/my-files/{ filename }' as '{ filename }
WORKDIR /my-files/

# Move Nginx config files (basically, configuring Nginx settings)
RUN cp ./default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default && cp ./load-balancer.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/load-balancer.conf

# Provide cached layer for node_module for installation
ADD package.json ./package.json
RUN npm install

# For your own taste, run as much node files as you wish for load-distribution
RUN nodejs ./{ Node App Code File }.js &
```

4. Expose Port
```
# Open port for Nginx
EXPOSE { Port Num }
```

5. Run `bash` when this image is ran by `docker`:
```
# Doing so can allow you to dynamically manipulate the container on-the-fly
CMD ["bash"]
```

6. Explicitly state the End-Of-File
```
EOF
```

### Build `Dockerfile`
Once you've managed to complete a `Dockerfile`, it's time to build it as an image with the following code:
```shell
sudo docker build -t { tag name } .
```
During this build process, docker needs `sudo` privilege as a directory with a Dockerfile(which is `.` in this case)

Once the build process is complete, check if the image is built properly with the following:
```shell
docker image ls
```

If everything went accordingly so far, run the app with the following:
```shell
sudo docker run -p { external port}:{ exposed port } { tag name }
```
***Note***: Docker's ubuntu image does not have `sudo` command in it. Execute `Docker` command with the `root` privilege for better practice
